<p>If you're someone who likes to find newer, faster, and more interesting ways of tackling programming problems, the DSA Wing is for you. Rebranded from the earlier Competitive Programming Wing, the DSA Wing is a place to engage in collaboration (and a little bit of competition). Together, we'll prepare for mid/large (Uber, Microsoft, Google, Ola) company technical interviews for internship/job opportunities, along with other programming contests like the ACM-ICPC, Google Kickstart, Facebook HackerCup etc. </p>
