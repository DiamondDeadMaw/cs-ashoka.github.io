>>> Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. It consists of a challenge that encourages people to contribute to any open source projects. The first 70,000 participants to complete the challenge will receive a bunch of free SWAG, including a limited edition Hacktoberfest t-shirt as a reward.
