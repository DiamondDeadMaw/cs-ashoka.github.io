# Explore CS Research with Prof Debayan

## The session 
This session was organized by the Research Wing of the Computer Science Society on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February, 2021. This was an informative session for the entire student body by Professor Debayan Gupta, Assistant Professor at Ashoka University, about how Computer Science research works at Ashoka. Professor Debayan also talked about interdisciplinary research and its importance in the current day. It was an hour long session with 70+ attendees.

Research is something that's often interpreted as boring and intimidating. This session was organized solely for the purpose of helping it become more accessible to student, promoting the idea that "research is for everyone". This session also helped debunk several myths the students had, like the fact that students in their first year cannot participate in CS Research while actually, they can.
