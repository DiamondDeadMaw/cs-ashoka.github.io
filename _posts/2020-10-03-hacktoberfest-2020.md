Hacktoberfest 2020 is a month-long event powered by DigitalOcean, Intel, and DEV to promote the culture of open-source software. In our workshop this Sunday 'Introduction to Git and GitHub', you'll be learning all about Version Control and be prepared to start contributing to the open-source community! If you actively contribute to public repositories in October (and we'll teach you all of this!), you'll be getting a free Official Hacktoberfest T-Shirt from DigitalOcean and many more developer swags!

If you're new to this, we highly recommend attending our introductory workshop (open to all Ashokans), which is officially recognized by DigitalOcean and listed here. All workshop attendees will also get access to official Hacktoberfest resources, cheatsheets, and goodies.
