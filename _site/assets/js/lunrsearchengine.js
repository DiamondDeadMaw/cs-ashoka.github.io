    "body": "The CS Society at Ashoka is a rapidly growing space for like-minded people to come together, explore and nurture their interests in Computer Science. The Society has 3 main verticals covering CS Research, Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development, Machine Learning and much more.  Over the past years, we have conducted multiple interactive workshops, panel discussions, competitions and other events for the CS community on campus and beyond. Among the more notable events, we've partnered with DigitalOcean and CodeChef to conduct various competitions and events throughout the year, conducted Google's ExploreML program on campus and are currently working on Ashoka's first-ever hackathon, RedBrick Hacks. In the past, we've invited guest speakers from our Microsoft Research India, Stanford University and even our own CS faculty.  For the future, we plan on increasing the number of innovative events and taking more steps towards building a healthy community of interdisciplinary computer science enthusiasts.

Hence, we are opening inductions to The Computer Science Society‚Äôs Core Team. Each of the three wings has their own core team that together make up the Society‚Äôs Core Team. The three wings are:  Development and Machine Learning - Join us to help plan and conduct workshops and events aimed at learning new languages, platforms and developing new applications. Current Leadership: Tanvi Roy (PoC), Soham De Data Structures and Algorithms - Rebranded from the earlier Competitive Programming Wing, join us to plan discussions and training events for technical interviews and international programming competitions. Current Leadership: Akshat Singh, Vibodh Nautiyal CS Research - If reading research papers, and learning about new advancements in the field of Computer Science is for you, join the CS Research wing, where we‚Äôll organize reading sessions and conduct independent research on exciting themes. Current Leadership: Manish Rajani (PoC)Please note, while you are welcome to be a member of as many (or all) of the wings, we would recommend you to opt for leadership in only a single department (keeping in mind your time constraints). Update: Inductions have conducluded and we‚Äôre very happy to welcome a very talented group of people to the core of the CS Society! We wish them the best and look forward to working with them. "

Professor Debayan also talked about interdisciplinary research and its importance in the current day. It was an hour long session with 70+ attendees. If you wish to watch the recording of this session, email us on cs. society@ashoka. edu. in About CS Research: Research is something that‚Äôs often interpreted as boring and intimidating. This session was organized solely for the purpose of helping it become more accessible to student, promoting the idea that ‚Äúresearch is for everyone‚Äù. This session also helped debunk several myths the students had, like the fact that students in their first year cannot participate in CS Research while actually, they can. Research Wing: The research wing of the CS society works on organizing events like this and conducting several other projects, ranging from facilitating research to organizing reading groups. The membership for the research wing is open: one can simply join the WhatsApp group where all the announcements are made. Email us for more info! "

    "body": "2021/02/06 - LaTeX is often made to seem more complicated than it really is. But what is it really? LaTeX is a:  Document Preparation System It‚Äôs kindof a programming language for documents It‚Äôs pronounced Lay-tech or Lah-tech not Lay-teks.  It‚Äôs not WYSIWIG (What You See is What You Get)Why should any of us use LaTeX? In one word, it‚Äôs control. With Office Productivity software like Microsoft Office Word, sure you can make a pretty document, but you can‚Äôt create a header with pre-programmed author names, automatically updating dates and custom styling (or maybe you can, but then you‚Äôll have to use your mouse and click through a bunch of different menus looking for the right setting, and then something will go wrong, and then you‚Äôll try something else‚Ä¶ and the list goes on and on). And if there‚Äôs ever anything that you can‚Äôt do using LaTeX, not to worry! LaTeX has modules and packaages that you can install and import, that do all sorts of things for you - from predefined algorithm notations, coloured code outputs, even coordinate-based diagram drawing. So, how do we get started with LaTeX?: Well, there‚Äôs a bunch of things you could do. You could go the fancy way and install a LaTeX editor on your computer (TexMaker on Windows, MacTeX on OSX), or you could go the easy way and use Overleaf - which is what we‚Äôre going to do because we‚Äôre lazy and this is fast! It‚Äôs pretty easy to use their interface to quickly build your first LaTeX document - be it your Discrete Math assignment, or the next ground-breaking research paper. Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm quite there yet‚Ä¶: That‚Äôs okay, here‚Äôs a brief overview of what all is there:  Preamble     Packages - \usepackage{packagename}   Document Type - \documentclass{article|book}   Other Metadata - \title{Sample}, \author{CS Society}    The Body     Environments         These are basically enclosed spaces that have a specific output format. They have a \begin and an \end (like most living things).      Examples             Math (Inline) - $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2 \cdot a \cdot b$       Math (Multiline) - \begin{align*} . . . \end{align*} (The * omits automatic line numbering, if you simply do \begin{align} each line will have a number)       Numbered Lists - \begin{enumerate} \item . . . \item . . . \end{enumerate}       Bullet Lists - \begin{itemize} \item . . . \item . . . \end{itemize}       Tables - \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |} . . . \end{tabular}                     Commands         Formatting, alignment, all sorts of other fun things:     Examples             Bold - \textbf{Bold}       Italics - \textit{Italics}       Underline - \underline{Underline (This document wasn't written in LaTeX unfortunately)}       Section - \section{Section Name}       Section (Unnumbered) - \section*{Unnumbered Section Name}       Math Symbols - \int \sum \prod \times \cdot \infty       Math Exponents - \sqrt[n]{a} A^{20}_{10}       Math Fractions - \frac{10}{20}                     Okay, I got this, what‚Äôs next?: Now that you‚Äôve covered the basics, what remains is to get good, and then do the fancy pro-stuff. Here‚Äôs some stuff to get started:  Bibliography Diagrams using TikZ Templates Make a Stylish LaTeX Resume Markdown - All the blogs on this website were written on Markdown, another popular (but less powerful) typesetting format. That‚Äôs a lot to keep track of, isn‚Äôt it?: It sure is! That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a whole bunch of different LaTeX cheatsheets available online that list the most commonly used environments, commands and packages. Here‚Äôs a few that might be useful:  Winston Chang‚Äôs Cheatsheet - Geared towards Scientific Papers University of Massachusetts Amherst - A Super Brief, Yet Super Awesome, LaTeX Cheat SheetHave fun creating many many pretty documents in the future!

    "body": "2020/11/13 - This workshop was conducted as a preliminary introduction to Machine Learning, without any prerequisite knowledge of Programming, Statistics or Calculus. This isn‚Äôt a formal gateway or introduction to the field, but a nosedive into deep-learning, involving a hands-on project. In under 60 minutes, the workshop participants gained a high-level understanding of how machines learn and built their first image classifier (using Google‚Äôs Teachable Machines). What is Machine Learning?: Machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn. Atleast that was the motivating idea when it started. Machine Learning falls under the larger umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which concerns machines that are capable of doing tasks requiring ‚Äòhuman intelligence‚Äô. The following illustration should help illustrate this: How do Machines learn?: The process of supervised machine learning can be broadly broken down into 3 distinct steps (following this example from UC Berkeley):  A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.  An Error Function: An error function serves to evaluate the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.  A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met. Challenges in today‚Äôs Machine Learning: Privacy: In 2016, European Union passed the GDPR to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic Area. Some US states are also developing policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which require businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. This recent legislation has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable data (PII). This affects the availability of data for training Machine Learning models. This problem gave birth to an active area of research in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Bias and Discrimination: In their effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally biased potential job candidates by gender for open technical roles, and they ultimately had to scrap the project. Many similar events have raised other pointed questions around the use of AI within hiring practices, such as what data should you be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role. Bias and discrimination aren‚Äôt limited to the human resources function either; it can be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media algorithms. Accountability: Since there isn‚Äôt significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real enforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for companies to adhere to these guidelines are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system to the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI models within society. Workshop Slides and Recordings: Recordings are availabe on the CS Society drive (shared internally) "
